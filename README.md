# The Interplay Between Poverty, Education and Crime in Ecuador

*By: Angel Munoz*

## Executive Summary
This project addresses the issue of crime in Ecuador, aiming to understand the relationship between poverty, education, and insecurity. Using open data from various government sources, the analysis seeks to provide a clear view of how the lack of investment in education might be contributing to the rise in crime, especially in areas with high poverty levels.

The project is based on the premise that improving education in the most disadvantaged regions can have a positive impact on reducing crime. Through data analysis and the creation of visualizations, the project will offer evidence-based recommendations for public policy.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Here are the 5 KPIs that will be used to measure the impact of poverty and education on crime rates:

### Crime Rate by Province:
Provides direct insight into where crime is most prevalent, allowing policymakers and community leaders to identify hotspots of insecurity. By comparing crime statistics across different provinces, stakeholders can correlate high crime regions with other factors such as poverty levels and inadequate education funding. Consequently, this measure not only highlights the immediate challenges in public safety but also serves as a starting point for deeper investigations into underlying issues.

#### Homicides by Province
Homicide rates by province provide a clear picture of violent crime distribution across Ecuador. Tracking these numbers annually from 2019 to 2024 helps identify trends, regional disparities, and potential links to socioeconomic factors like poverty and education investment. Understanding these patterns enables policymakers to implement targeted crime prevention strategies.

Technical Detail:
* Frequency: Anually
* Range: Whole number, between 0 and 10,000.
* Time Period: 2019-2024

#### Prisioners by Province
The number of people detained by the justice system in each province provides insight into law enforcement activity and judicial trends. Analyzing this data for 2024-2025 helps identify regions with higher detention rates and their possible connection to crime, security, and justice policies. This information is essential for assessing the effectiveness of the judicial system and exploring preventive measures.

Technical Detail:
* Frequency: Anually
* Range: Whole number, between 51 and 14,616.
* Time Period: 2024-2025

### Poverty due to Unsatisfied Basic Needs:
**Poverty due to Unsatisfied Basic Needs** provides a comprehensive measure of deprivation by analyzing the percentage of people living in poverty based on essential living conditions. By breaking the data down into national, urban, and rural sectors, it highlights disparities in access to housing quality, basic services, education, and economic stability. Tracking this data annually from 2008 to 2024 allows policymakers to assess the impact of social programs, economic shifts, and infrastructure development. Understanding these trends is crucial for designing targeted interventions to reduce poverty and improve overall living conditions.

Technical Detail:
* Frequency: Anually
* Range: Percentage, between 0 and 100.
* Time Period: 2008-2024

### Education Investment:
Understanding how much a country invests in education is crucial to assessing its commitment to long-term development and social mobility. By analyzing the percentage of total government expenditure allocated to education, policymakers can gauge whether funding is sufficient to improve infrastructure, train teachers, and provide quality learning materials. Comparing this investment to crime rates and poverty levels can reveal patterns that suggest whether underfunding in education contributes to social instability. A well-funded education system has the potential to reduce crime by offering better opportunities, equipping individuals with skills for employment, and fostering a sense of civic responsibility.

Technical Detail:
* Frequency: Anually
* Range: Percentage, between 0 and 100
* Time Period: 2009-2023

### School Registration Rate:
Tracking the number of school enrollment across different provinces and between rural and urban areas provides valuable insights into access to education and social equity. A high registration rate suggests effective educational policies and accessibility, while low rates may indicate barriers such as economic hardship, lack of infrastructure, or cultural factors that discourage attendance. Analyzing this data from 2009 to 2023 allows for the identification of trends and the impact of policy changes over time. Additionally, comparing school registration rates with crime and poverty levels can help determine whether limited access to education correlates with higher social vulnerability and criminal activity.

Technical Detail:
* Frequency: Anually
* Range: Whole number, 16,140 - 27,651 students
* Time Period: 2009-2023
