# Executive Summary
This project addresses the issue of crime in Ecuador, aiming to understand the relationship between poverty, education, and insecurity. Using open data from various government sources, the analysis seeks to provide a clear view of how the lack of investment in education might be contributing to the rise in crime, especially in areas with high poverty levels.

The project is based on the premise that improving education in the most disadvantaged regions can have a positive impact on reducing crime. Through data analysis and the creation of visualizations, the project will offer evidence-based recommendations for public policy.
