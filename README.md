# The Interplay Between Poverty, Education and Crime in Ecuador

*By: Angel Munoz*

## Executive Summary
This project addresses the issue of crime in Ecuador, aiming to understand the relationship between poverty, education, and insecurity. Using open data from various government sources, the analysis seeks to provide a clear view of how the lack of investment in education might be contributing to the rise in crime, especially in areas with high poverty levels.

The project is based on the premise that improving education in the most disadvantaged regions can have a positive impact on reducing crime. Through data analysis and the creation of visualizations, the project will offer evidence-based recommendations for public policy.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Here are the 5 KPIs that will be used to measure the impact of poverty and education on crime rates:

### Crime Rate by Region:
<mark>Consider expanding these with a paragraph to each KPI that emphasizes the value of understanding that KPI. For example, I'll propose the first one</mark> 

Provides direct insight into where crime is most prevalent, allowing policymakers and community leaders to identify hotspots of insecurity. By comparing crime statistics across different areas, stakeholders can correlate high crime regions with other factors such as poverty levels and inadequate education funding. Consequently, this measure not only highlights the immediate challenges in public safety but also serves as a starting point for deeper investigations into underlying issues.

~~Measures the number of crimes reported in different areas of Ecuador.~~
Technical Detail:
* Frequency: Monthly
* Range: Whole number, between 0 and 100.
* Time Period: 1970-2024


### Poverty Rate by Region:

### Education Investment by Region:
Measures the budget allocated for education in each region of Ecuador.
### Secondary School Graduation Rate:
Measures the percentage of young people who graduate from secondary education in different regions.
### Youth Unemployment Rate:
