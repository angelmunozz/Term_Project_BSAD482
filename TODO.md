* Fix the markdown, citations, etc.
* Download the data, and put it in the "data" directory.
* Start putting code in the code directory. Whatever visualizations we create, the code should go here.
* On paper, draw a storyboard of what you hope to visualize.  You may have to play around with the data to see the notable trends, but start with a pencil and paper.  This helps highlight the data you will need to curate to get the target dataset.
