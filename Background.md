## Angel's Project Background
# The Correlation Between Poverty, Education and Crime. 

1. Problem Introduction: 
In Ecuador, the rising crime rates have been a persistent challenge in recent years, especially in areas with high poverty levels. Various studies have suggested that quality education could be a significant factor in reducing crime rates, as it provides young people with better job opportunities and keeps them away from criminal activities. Additionally, the lack of investment in the educational system in certain regions might be contributing to the vicious cycle of poverty and violence. This project aims to analyze the relationship between crime rates, education investment, and poverty levels in Ecuador to understand how the lack of education could be influencing insecurity.

2. Problem Context: 
Increasing insecurity in Ecuador has affected not only the quality of life of citizens but also the country's economy. Crime rates are concentrated mainly in urban areas with high poverty levels, where access to quality education is limited. Public investment in education is crucial to improve employment opportunities and reduce inequality, which can directly impact crime prevention. This analysis will attempt to identify patterns between these three variables using open data.

3. Importance of the Study: 
This study is important because it will help understand the connection between poverty, education, and crime, providing valuable insights for public policies that could reduce violence in the country. Furthermore, the findings could serve as a foundation for future research addressing similar issues in other contexts.

4. Project Objectives: 
Analyze how poverty levels and the lack of investment in education influence crime rates in different regions of Ecuador.
Develop visualizations showing the relationship between these three variables.
Provide recommendations for improving public safety through education.
